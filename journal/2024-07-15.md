## Learnings:
-  What did you learn today? 
- largest learning today is that I do not know much
which both sucks and it a good thing because it means
in everyway I grow I will be growing in a way that is productive.
I do need to start a learning plan that I can reference.
self study does not have the luxury of course work being planned for
you. Which is also it's biggest benefit. I can study how I see fit

on a more overview higher level I do feel as if I have a better understanding of 
ml concepts, In which I will have to write about later today when I take notes


## Challenges:
Lack of direction today, mostly just reading, not much doing. I'd
say for the better part of the next two weeks It will be mostly all reading




## Reflections:
-  Reflect on your day. What went well? What could have been better?
